ICFP 2015 Cthulhu Tetris
========================

http://icfpcontest.org/

Lightning entry:

 * Nothing fancy. The algorithm is stupid:
   "Try to use a power phrase ("Ei!") at the beginning of every unit,
    then pile them up in the middle."


Runtime and dependencies
------------------------

 * Tested with Python 2.7.6
 * Requires "argparse"
 * Also requires "json" and "copy" but they should be built-in


HAIL CTHULHU! ^(;,;)^
