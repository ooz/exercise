# JavaScript

I recently discovered ["Eloquent JavaScript" by M. Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net) which seems to be a common introduction to both programming and JavaScript, e.g. for bootcamp students.
So far, I followed a conservative philosophy of "the least amount of JS you can get away with" and thus my JS skills are limited:

* Static page tools: [Lifetime Clock](https://oliz.io/lifetime-clock/), [Kitchen Cleaning Plan](https://github.com/ooz/kitchen-cleaning-plan) ([with tests run in browser](https://oliz.io/kitchen-cleaning-plan/test.html))
* Minor accessibility features in vanilla JS used in [ggpy](https://github.com/ooz/ggpy): https://github.com/ooz/templates/blob/master/html/oz-accessibility.js
* Unoptimized, non-modular Electron app using React.js: https://github.com/ooz/flow-charter
* Unoptimized, non-modular game jam games using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/): [Ogre Forge](https://oliz.io/ogre-forge/), [home is](https://oliz.io/home-is/), [Handshake](https://oliz.io/handshake/)

Study goals:

* Level-up JS skills, understand prototypic features
* Learn and write modern JS instead of a mix of various language features/standards
* Understand JS module system, dependency management, bundling and webpack
* Get started with Node.js, learn basic API
